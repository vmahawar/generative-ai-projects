The project combines foundational concepts from Kaggle’s Generative AI Intensive (Q1 2025) with advanced techniques such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), Few-Shot Prompting, Function Calling, and custom prompt engineering.\n\nThis notebook classifies user text responses to detect potential mental health concerns, generates contextual insights, and assigns severity scores using large language models. It also demonstrates practical integrations of generative AI into health tech applications, pushing the boundaries of responsible and interactive AI design.\n\n**Key Components**:\n\n**Text Classification via Prompt-Driven LLMs**: Utilizes prompt-based generative AI for classifying textual inputs into mental health-related categories.\n\n**Severity Scoring (1–10 Scale)**: Assigns interpretable severity levels using prompt engineering combined with few-shot examples and function calling for precision.\n\n**Sentiment Categorization**: Introduces a new feature column labeling each entry as Positive, Negative, or Neutral based on the severity score and sentiment cues.\n\n**Dataset-Wide Distribution Analysis**: Computes and visualizes the percentage breakdown of mental health statuses, helping surface key trends and risk segments.\n\n**Actionable Interventions**: Leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to suggest personalized and context-aware interventions aimed at promoting mental well-being.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"---","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Setup","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Install the SDK","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"!pip uninstall -qy jupyterlab  # Remove unused packages from Kaggle's base image that conflict\n!pip install -U -q \"google-genai==1.7.0\"","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-04-09T13:30:50.728834Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-04-09T13:30:50.729365Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-04-09T13:30:56.683678Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-04-09T13:30:50.729330Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-04-09T13:30:56.682293Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"code","source":"from google import genai\nfrom google.genai import types\n\nfrom IPython.display import HTML, Markdown, display","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-04-09T13:30:56.685404Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-04-09T13:30:56.685741Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-04-09T13:30:56.690102Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-04-09T13:30:56.685711Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-04-09T13:30:56.689159Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Set up a retry helper.

Give step-by-step explanations for your rating, and only choose ratings from the Rating Rubric.\n\nBelow are a few examples:\n\n---\n\nUser message: \"I feel like there's no purpose in my life anymore.\"\nLabel: 1 (positive for mental health issue)\nEvaluation: The user expresses signs of deep emotional distress and hopelessness, which may indicate depression.\nScore: 9\nRating: VERY_VERY_BAD\n\n---\n\nUser message: \"Just had a long day. Looking forward to a good night's sleep.\"\nLabel: 0 (not indicative of mental health issue)\nEvaluation: The message reflects tiredness but no sign of mental health issues.\nScore: 2\nRating: VERY_GOOD\n\n---\n\n# Evaluation\n## Metric Definition\nYou will be assessing summarization quality, which measures the overall ability to summarize text. Pay special attention to length constraints, such as in X words or in Y sentences. The instruction for performing a summarization task and the context to be summarized are provided in the user prompt. The response should be shorter than the text in the context. The response should not contain information that is not present in the context.\n\n## Criteria\nMentall Wellbeing: The response demonstrates a Mental State of the person, satisfying all of the instruction's requirements.\nGroundedness: The response contains information included only in the context. The response does not reference any outside information.\nAnxiety: The response checks for Anxiety if any.\nStress: The response checks for stress.\n\n## Rating Rubric\n10: (WORST). The patient's mental state is extremely poor and requires urgent attention.\n9: (VERY_VERY_BAD). The patient's mental state is very severely compromised; immediate intervention strongly advised.\n8: (VERY_BAD). The patient's mental state is severely compromised; professional assistance needed promptly.\n7: (BAD). The patient's mental state is significantly compromised; recommend seeking help soon.\n6: (MODERATE_BAD). The patient shows moderate signs of mental health issues; monitoring or professional support advised.\n5: (NEUTRAL). The patient's mental state is borderline, neither clearly healthy nor unhealthy; regular monitoring recommended.\n4: (MODERATE_GOOD). The patient's mental state is fairly good; minimal issues present, maintain current support.\n3: (GOOD). The patient's mental state is healthy with minor or occasional concerns; generally doing well.\n2: (VERY_GOOD). The patient is mentally well with very minor or no issues; no immediate concerns.\n1: (BEST). The patient's mental state is excellent; no signs of distress or mental health concerns.\n\n\n## Evaluation Steps\nSTEP 1: Assess the text responses in aspects of instruction following whether person is having anxiety, depression or other mental health issues according to the criteria.\nSTEP 2: Score based on the rubric.\n\n# User Input text responses and label\n## User Inputs text response\n\n### Text Response\n{text}\n\n## Label\n{label}\n\"\"\"\n\n# Define a structured enum class to capture the result.\nclass SummaryRating(enum.Enum):\n  WORST = '10'\n  VERY_VERY_BAD = '9'\n  VERY_BAD = '8'\n  BAD = '7'\n  MODERATE_BAD = '6'\n  NEUTRAL = '5'\n  MODERATE_GOOD = '4'\n  GOOD = '3'\n  VERY_GOOD = '2'\n  BEST = '1'","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-04-09T13:31:08.946433Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-04-09T13:31:08.946827Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-04-09T13:31:08.953214Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-04-09T13:31:08.946788Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-04-09T13:31:08.952388Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### create method eval_summary","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import functools\n\n@functools.cache\ndef eval_summary(text_response, label):\n  \"\"\"Evaluate the generated text responses against the label.\"\"\"\n\n  chat = client.chats.create(\n    model=\"gemini-2.0-flash\",\n    config=types.GenerateContentConfig(\n        system_instruction=SUMMARY_PROMPT  # This is your long-term context!\n    ))\n\n  # Generate the full text response.\n  # response = chat.send_message(\n  #     message=SUMMARY_PROMPT.format(text=text_response, label=label)\n  # )\n\n  response = chat.send_message(f\"User message: {text_response}, Label: {label}\")\n    \n  verbose_eval = response.text\n\n  # Coerce into the desired structure.\n  structured_output_config = types.GenerateContentConfig(\n      response_mime_type=\"text/x.enum\",\n      response_schema=SummaryRating,\n  )\n  response = chat.send_message(\n      message=\"Convert the final score.\",\n      config=structured_output_config,\n  )\n  structured_eval = response.parsed\n\n  # Extract the numeric rating from structured_eval\n  numeric_rating = structured_eval.value\n\n  # Map numeric rating back to the enum description clearly\n  summary_rating = structured_eval.name\n\n  return verbose_eval, numeric_rating, summary_rating","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-04-09T13:31:08.954009Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-04-09T13:31:08.954272Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-04-09T13:31:08.959988Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-04-09T13:31:08.954250Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-04-09T13:31:08.959045Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### test method eval_summary","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"text_eval, score, struct_eval = eval_summary(text_response=df['text'][0], label=df['label'][0])\nprint((text_eval))\nprint(struct_eval)","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-04-09T13:31:08.961023Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-04-09T13:31:08.961339Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-04-09T13:31:09.846914Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-04-09T13:31:08.961314Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-04-09T13:31:09.845681Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### create a wrapper method get_score_and_feedback\nThis creates new features -
